# DOS Scripts
Collection of batch files, that I use personally.

## Installation
Download the package from Github and unzip it. Then, add those scripts to any folder in the *PATH* environment or add the folder containing these scripts to it.

## List
Here is the list of batch scripts and a short description of what they do.

| Script Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| gotocode.bat | Jumps to C:\Users\\"username"\Documents\Code |
| listings.bat | Executes the command "dir /o /b:gn" and saves the output in a file|
| makeprompts.bat | Creates a user specified amount of command prompts |
| editor.bat | Creates a new file and opens it up for editing |
| systemfetch.bat | Batch script to display system info like neofetch |

## Usage
Restart the *Command Prompt* to access the new scripts if you get an error on the lines of "Command not found". Otherwise, just type in the script file name.

## Notes:
1. Update `gotocode.bat` with your own username.
